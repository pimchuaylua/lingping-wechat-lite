                Lingping Club is a community of curious minds exploring the world through languages, cultures, and
                shared perspectives.<br><br>

                We offer a variety of activities, including language corners (English, Thai, and Chinese), book clubs,
                and movie clubs. Members from all over the world are welcome to join online from anywhere. All
                activities are organized by our members — we believe in learning through sharing and meaningful
                conversation.<br><br>

                Lingping Club is a global online community based in Chiang Mai. We also host quarterly offline events in
                several cities across China, including Chengdu, Changsha, Wuhan, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and more.
